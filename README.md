# shopify
Doing some development on shopify!

Modifying the Supply Theme to include a drag and drop cart.

After multiple edits I realized it was better to place the drag and drop code in it's own snippet.

The files from this branch that you would need to update are:

theme.liquid
product-grid-item.liquid
product-list-item.liquid

It is also important to add the snippet

dragdrop.liquid

There is no need to update the collection.liquid file.
